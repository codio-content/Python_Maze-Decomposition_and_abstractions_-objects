So, how do we reference an object with our code?

Take a look at the code on the left hand side. Here, we are displaying the X and Y coordinate of the player when the 'C' key is pressed.

## Methods
You see that when the 'C' key is pressed, we are moving the player up and to the right.

- `player.moveUp()`
- `player.moveRight()`
