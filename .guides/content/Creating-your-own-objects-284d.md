So far, we've been using an object that is created by our game framework, which is hidden away from you.

Now let's see how we can create our own object.

Let's say we want to create an object that stores the following information each time a turn is taken using the `turnTaken` function on the left.

- The X and Y coordinates of the player
- The current score
- The current amount of energy

## Object creation
Don't worry about the code before line 5. This is used to define a blueprint for out object, we have defined an empty blueprint and then added our own data in the `turnTaken` function.
