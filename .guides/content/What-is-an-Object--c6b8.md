Objects are conceptually quite simple to understand.

|||definition
In Javascript, an object is a data structure that can contain properties and methods. Different programming languages use slightly different terminology but the principles are similar.

- **Properties** are usually simple variable values (see the table below) but can also be other (nested) objects.
- **Methods** *do something*. In code, they are functions that live within an object. From our earlier unit you should know that a function is a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task.

A key purpose of an object is to encapsulate all things relating to that object into a single structure that is defined as one coherent unit.

That definition sounds a bit dry, so let's illustrate it with some examples.

## Real World Objects
Programming objects are analagous to real world objects. For example, lets think of a smartphone as an object.

See how the Properties are just values, whereas the Methods actually perform an action or task.

| Object | Properties | Methods |
|-|-|-|
| **Phone** | Color | Power On |
|       | Manufacturer | Power Off |
|       | Model | Make a Call |
|       | Screen Size | Send a Text |
|       | Price | Run an Application |
